1.Add at least 3 Project features

a. User Profile Management:

Implement a user profile management system where users can create and update their profiles. Allow them to add personal information such as name, contact details, profile picture, and a short bio.
Enable users to view their course registration history, including current and past courses.
Add an option for users to reset their passwords or update their email addresses securely.

b.Course Recommendations:

Implement a course recommendation system that suggests courses to users based on their previous registrations, interests, or academic history.
Utilize machine learning algorithms or collaborative filtering to provide personalized course suggestions.
Allow users to filter and sort courses based on various criteria like subject, difficulty level, and instructor rating.

c. Payment Integration:

Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to allow users to pay for courses during registration.
Implement secure payment processing and storage of payment details following industry standards for security.
Provide users with options for different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.) and ensure a seamless checkout experience.
These additional features will enhance the overall user experience and make your course registration React project more comprehensive and valuable for both students and administrators.


2.Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.


a. Local Component State:

*For simpler projects, you can manage state locally within individual React components.
*Use the useState hook to create and manage component-level state variables.
*This approach is suitable for managing UI-related state, such as form inputs, modal visibility, or temporary data

b.Context API:

*For medium-sized projects with the need to share state among multiple components, you can use React's Context API.
*Create a context that holds the shared state and provide it at the top of your component tree.
*Use the useContext hook to access and update the shared state.
